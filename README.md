# PhotoBrowser Task for Futurice application process.

---

#### Built with Angular _(via cli)_ using Typescript and custom SCSS with font awesome icons and some bootstrap icons

This is a basic App using the  [jsonplaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ "Free Json Server Service") api for endpoints.
The App is a angular-cli project that is in development mode and has **NOT** been ejected,
so most of the boier plate code is there, and will be compiled on run. There are tests there
but they have been created automatically by Angular there is no full coverage, and I did not
write tests in addition.

The app is definatley **NOT** responsive, as I tend to work on that once functionality and basic UI is implemted,
whilst there are a few media queries,they were experiments, and I have not responsified it further for now, due to time constaints.
The SCSS rules and some of the Typescript are a litte bloated and with a proper project and time, I would refactor more and abstract out common properties, as it is,
the **DRY** principle mayhae been a little ignored! :D

This app is best viewed in the latest **__CHROME__** or **__FIREFOX__** __(though with Firefox, there may be some grid issues)__;

Its not shiny amazing looking, and please excuse the poor design ticks, I was more focused on achieveing the breif than producing a fully responsive working app. There may be some extra libraries hanging around from tests, so ignore them, if thjis were a full project, they would be cleaned up
